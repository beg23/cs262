Managable Project: An app which categorizes Calvin students based on interests that they share.
These could be predefined categories selected by the app or could have some made by students themselves.
Then the app could find other students which hold the most shared interests with you.

Super Cool Project: An app which checks the logic of your Mathematical proofs. This would utilize photo to text conversion
to turn your written proof into a digital format. This way you could show the grader what for when they claim that
your perfectly reasonable proof isn't correct, or better yet, it could make the grader totally obsolete.
