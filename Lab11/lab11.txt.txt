Homework 1:

Updated versions in build.gradle
Added backup_descriptor.xml file
Used unused function parameter
Fixed import in test java file

Did not fix "App is not indexable by Google Search..." because it didn't seem relevant
Did not remove unused parameter in calculateAnswer() because it is an onClick method so it needs to recieve a View

Homework 2:

Fixed typo in "timeout"
Updated versions in build.gradle
Replace ellipse with ellipse char
Removed unused imports
Removed redundant type cast

Did not remove usesCleartextTraffic because this was necessary for my code to work
Did not fix "App is not indexable by Google Search..." because it didn't seem relevant
Did not fix "On SDK vers 23 and up, you app data will be auto backed up..." because it didn't seem relevant
Kept deprecated getSupportLoaderManager() because I wouldn't know what to replace it with to not break it
Did not make things private or package private because it seemed to break the app
Did not make things final, private, or package private because one or more of these made my hw3 break, so I was too scared to change it

Homework 3:

Constrained recyclerview
Updated versions in build.gradle
Commented out unused methods
Corrected some typos which were legitimate spelling issues, but fake names (ie Tahu) or technical terms (ie. RESTful or mullipotent) I kept
Made fields into local vars
Removed unused imports
Added @NonNull to @Overriden @NonNull params and function
Removed redundant background colors
Removed unused xml resources
Replace ellipse with ellipse char

Did not add missing autofillHints since it is only used in certain versions
Did not fix "App is not indexable by Google Search..." because it didn't seem relevant
Did not fix "On SDK vers 23 and up, you app data will be auto backed up..." because it didn't seem relevant
Did not remove certain query functions and variables because in theory they would be useful if the app was expanded
Did not make things private or package private because it seemed to break the app
Did not make things final because it seemed to break the app
(One of those last 2 broke the app not sure which so didn't do either)
Did not add body to xml with blank body because there wasn't anything relevent to add to my knowledge



Apart from all of these, there was the changes made automatically from Code->ReformatCode which primarily includes small style changes like spacing in comments or brace placement or some random xml I think
I didn't really see much if any JavaDoc recommendations even though I'm sure I missed some documentation, but oh well
